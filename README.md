## 🗃️ Generating Emoji Database

To create your emoji database, use the included Python script:

```bash
cd data
python generate-emoji-json.py
```

This will create the `emojis.json` file with a comprehensive emoji database including keywords for searching.

> **⚠️ Important:** The `generate-emoji-json.py` script is for local development only. Do not include this file when deploying to a web server for security reasons. Only deploy the generated `emojis.json` file along with your HTML, CSS, and other web assets.
